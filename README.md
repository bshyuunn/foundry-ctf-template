# foundry-ctf-template
This template is based on [Zellic's example-ctf-challenge](https://github.com/Zellic/example-ctf-challenge), which was updated by [minaminao](https://github.com/minaminao/tokyo-payload?tab=readme-ov-file), and further enhanced to streamline the process of developing challenges using this template.


## Getting Started
```
$ forge init --template bshyuunn/foundry-ctf-template my-solidity-challenge
$ cd my-solidity-challenge
$ make
$ nc localhost 31337
```

## Creating Your Own Challenge
First, place your custom challenge files in the `src/` directory. The `Setup.col` file is essential, and you also need to implement the `isSolved` function to check if the challenge has been solved. Other environment setup tasks should be handled in the constructor. 

Additionally, you can write a script to solve the challenge in the `script/` directory, and you can add test code for your challenge in the `test/` directory.

Next, to configure the environment for your challenge, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file. Change `simple-challenge:` to the name of your challenge and adjust other values in the file to fit your challenge's environment.
```yml
services:
  simple-challenge:
    build: ./build
    ports:
      - "31337:31337"
      - "8545:8545"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - FLAG=CTF{FLAG}
      - PORT=31337
      - HTTP_PORT=8545
      - PUBLIC_IP=localhost
      - SHARED_SECRET=47066539167276956766098200939677720952863069100758808950316570929135279551683
      - SETUP_CONTRACT_VALUE=0
      - USER_VALUE=10000000000000
      - EVM_VERSION=cancun # `cancun`, `shanghai`, `paris`, `london`, etc...
```

1. **`FLAG`**  
   The secret value participants need to find.

2. **`PORT`**  
   The port for service communication (default: `31337`).<br>
   If changed, also update `docker-compose.yml` under `ports: - "31337:31337"`.

4. **`HTTP_PORT`**  
   The port for RPC communication with the Ethereum node (default: `8545`). <br>
   If changed, also update `docker-compose.yml` under `ports: - "8545:8545"`.

5. **`PUBLIC_IP`**  
   The public IP for hosting the service (set to `localhost` for local development).

6. **`SHARED_SECRET`**  
   An authentication value used when creating a blockchain network internally. (this value should be set randomly)

7. **`SETUP_CONTRACT_VALUE`**  
   The value sent to the Setup Contract (default: `0`).

8. **`USER_VALUE`**  
   The initial balance value for the CTF player.

9. **`EVM_VERSION`**  
   The Ethereum version to use (`cancun`, `shanghai`, `paris`, etc.).

Additionally, when changing the `EVM_VERSION`, make sure to properly set the desired version in the `foundry.toml` file as well:
```toml
[profile.default]

evm_version = "cancun"  # Set to your desired version, such as `cancun`, `shanghai`, `paris`, `london`, etc.
```
